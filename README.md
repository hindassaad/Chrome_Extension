### Chrome_Extension :eyes:

Every 20 minutes, eye Doctors say you should take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away. This is known as the 20/20/20 rule, and this extension reminds you of it!

**Features:**
- Starts a 20-minute countdown when turned on.
- Displays a 20-second reminder popup when the countdown ends.
- Allows users to select from different sounds (beep, chime, bell) for the reminder.
- Simple user interface to start or stop the countdown.
- Saves the state of the timer even if the browser is closed or restarted.
